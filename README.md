# neomorphism_instagram
This is an CSS and JS exercise where I implement neumorphism to a redesign of Instagram profile scream. Also, the Facebook basic display API was used in order to show up some data of a instagram user.

![]()

# User data displayed
The project use **the user name**, **post count** and **photos** from a test instagram user.
